# historical-nfl-draft-data

A place to store data about historical NFL draft classes

The lion's share of the credit for this data goes to [Pro Football Reference Draft History](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/draft/), though I've made some formatting changes to make the data easier to handle, such as appending the year of the draft, separating the player name and the player ID, and changing the header information so that it is only on one line.

The SchoolNameCleaning.json file contains instructions for cleaning and converting the PFR CSV files using OpenRefine

There is also a text file with a csvkit command that can be used to join data.
